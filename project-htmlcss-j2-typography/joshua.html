	<h1>The best thing about the future is that it comes one day at a time..</h1>

	<h2>The difference between stupidity and genius is that genuis has its limit..</h2>

	<h3>If you want your children to listen, try talking softly to someone else..</h3>

	<h4>My opinions may have changed, but not the fact that i'm right..</h4>

	<h5>To be sure of hitting the target, shoot first, and call whatever you hit the target..</h5>

	<h6>Trouble knocked at the door, but hearing laughter, hurried away..</h6>

	<p>But the fact that some geniuses were laughed at does not imply that all who are laughed at are genuises. They laughed at Columbus, they laughed at Fulton, they laughed at the Wrights Brothers. But they also laughed at Bozo the clown..</p>

	<p>There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.There is another theory which states that this has already happened</p>

	<p>My grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was sixty. She’s ninety-seven now, and we don’t know where the hell she is..</p>
